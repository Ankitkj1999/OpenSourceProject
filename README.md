<h1>Question: Using any Open Source Software transfer the files from server to client. Explore other options of this open source software.</h1>

Intial steps to transfer files from a server to a client using FileZilla, follow these steps:

1. Download and install FileZilla on both the server and the client machines. FileZilla is available for Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.

2. Launch FileZilla on both machines. The user interface is similar on both the server and the client, but the settings will differ.

3. On the server machine, click on the "File" menu and select "Site Manager". Enter the server details such as hostname, port, username, and password. Click on the "Connect" button to establish a connection to the server.

4. On the client machine, click on the "File" menu and select "Site Manager". Enter the client details such as hostname, port, username, and password. Click on the "Connect" button to establish a connection to the client.

5. Once both the server and the client are connected, you can start transferring files between them. You can drag and drop files from one pane to the other, or you can use the transfer queue to manage multiple file transfers.
